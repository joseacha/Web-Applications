## Web Applications


Welcome to **Web Applications** here you will find a Collection/Portfolio of Web Applications created with various different programming languages.



<p>
A Web application is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface. Web services are Web apps by definition and many websites contain Web apps. Some might say that any website component that performs some function for the user qualifies as a Web app.
